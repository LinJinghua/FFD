https://github.com/cole-group/QUBEKit  
QUBEKit is python based force field derivation toolkit that allows users to derive accurate molecular mechanics parameters directly from quantum mechanical calculations.

http://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/RED/resp/
The RESP (Restrained ElectroStatic Potential) program fits the quantum mechanically calculated molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) at molecular surfaces using an atom-centered point charge model. This method was developed primarily by Bayly. A quantum mechanical program such as Gaussian, Jaguar, GAMESS, or Firefly must be used to generate the MEP input(s) for RESP.
